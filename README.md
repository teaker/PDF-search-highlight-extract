# PDF-search-highlight-extract
Quickly searches an OCR'd PDF file, highlights search terms and saves all pages containing search terms to new file.

Works with Python 3.8.  GUI using PyQt5.  

I frequently have to search through PDFs containing tens of thousands of pages.  In the past, I would have to manually highlight search terms and save all pages containing said terms to a new file. I could feel it draining my soul from my body, so I knew I had to create something to handle it for me.
